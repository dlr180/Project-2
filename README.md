# Project-2
Red vs Blue

For my second project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario where I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within my environment, ultimately gaining root access to that machine. As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during my pentesting/attacking engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and created visualizations for reporting.

Lastly, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.
